# Approximation of the cosine function using Taylor series - FPGA
### Miłosz Janik & Piotr Podkówka
### AGH SDUP Project
The aim of the project was to create software on the FPGA platform for calculating the approximate value of the cosine function in the range from 0 to 90 degrees using the Taylor series.

The project was implemented in two alternative versions. The first is to use the taylor_rtl module, which is based on the classic Taylor formula for approximating the cosine function. The second uses the taylor_horner_rtl module, which uses Horner's rule to reduce the number of multiplications performed.
